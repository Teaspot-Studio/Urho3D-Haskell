 Static 3D scene example.
 This sample demonstrates:
     - Creating a 3D scene with static content
     - Displaying the scene using the Renderer subsystem
     - Handling keyboard and mouse input to move a freelook camera

   Create the Octree component to the scene. This is required before adding any drawable components, or else nothing will
   show up. The default octree volume will be from (-1000, -1000, -1000) to (1000, 1000, 1000) in world coordinates; it
   is also legal to place objects outside the volume but their visibility can then not be checked in a hierarchically
   optimizing manner
