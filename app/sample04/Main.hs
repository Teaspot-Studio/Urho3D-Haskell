 Static 3D scene example.
 This sample demonstrates:
     - Creating a 3D scene with static content
     - Displaying the scene using the Renderer subsystem
     - Handling keyboard and mouse input to move a freelook camera

   Create the Octree component to the scene. This is required before adding any drawable components, or else nothing will
   show up. The default octree volume will be from (-1000, -1000, -1000) to (1000, 1000, 1000) in world coordinates; it
   is also legal to place objects outside the volume but their visibility can then not be checked in a hierarchically
   optimizing manner

   Create a directional light to the world so that we can see something. The light scene node's orientation controls the

  {-
   Create more StaticModel objects to the scene, randomly positioned, rotated and scaled. For rotation, we construct a
   quaternion from Euler angles where the Y angle (rotation about the Y axis) is randomized. The mushroom model contains
   LOD levels, so the StaticModel component will automatically select the LOD level according to the view distance (you'll
   see the model get simpler as it moves further away). Finally, rendering a large number of the same object with the
   same material allows instancing to be used, if the GPU supports it. This reduces the amount of CPU work in rendering the
   scene.
